The hotel was hosting  employees for two weeks  that were affected by the disease and were sent to isolate before returning to work.  The issue that the hotel was facing was having their staff be in contact with the quaranted guests. I proposed to create an application that allows contactless room service . The proposal was approved and  the web application was created. The application  consists of two main components: the frontend, and the backend, which manages the data and processes the orders. The application was user friendly which allowed the guest to order three meals  a day which included any add ons, allergies and diet restrictions.",
